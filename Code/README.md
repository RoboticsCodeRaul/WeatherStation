weather station scratch code
This is a dev area for working the deep sleep integration on the opengreenenergy weatherstation on instructables.com

Discussions outside of the instructables website. This is my private website, but may be easier to discuss as I do not administer the instructables page.

## MCU will wake for 3 reasons:

1. [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/BOOT-OK-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)Initial power on - When device powers on, MCU will briefly connect to the WiFi to get current time.

2. [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WAKE-EXT0-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)Wake on rain tip counter to increment counter and go back to sleep.

3. [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WAKE-TIMER-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)Wake at set time interval to read sensors and send to IOT data collection point.


## Open Items - Software

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-OPEN-critical.svg)](https://shields.io/)Rainfall in last 24h is currently last 23h, I'll circle back and fix this when everything else is working.
